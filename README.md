#House Directory System

This is the source code for my final semester project.

This is an simple application created using only the Cygwin Compiler. This application can store a directory of house with it's details.   
May contain numerous big or small bugs and may also contain unknown bottlenecks. It was tested only for a few times and are for demonstration purposes.


##How the program works

###Installation 

Basically after compiling it. Run the program for the first time inside the folder because it will create the files listed : 

- AccLog.happ
- HouseDatabase.happ
- RealEstateDataFile.happ

Exit the program, and run it again to see the basic menu. 

###Usage

Instruction are in the application during runtime.
(Not too detailed sorry)


###Authentication
 AccLog where it reads the admin credentials first line username and second line password as shown 
 
 ```
 MohdVara
 thepassword
 MohdVara2
 thepassword
 ```
 
Credential are in plain text so it's not secure and the authentication is just for demonstration purposes. 
  
#####Disclaimer 
 
 
This program is just for demonstration purposes and should not be used in any production grade system without substantial re-factoring of the source code. I will not be responsible for any loss or damage caused by the program. 
   
Any question please send me a message.
