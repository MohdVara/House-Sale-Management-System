This is the source code for my group's final semester 1 project.

This is an simple application created using only the Cygwin Compiler. This application can store a directory of house with it's details. Design and user flow was created by my group as a tema but the coding part I have to refactor their coding a lot due to time constrait of 2 months.   
May contain numerous big or small bugs and may also contain unknown bottlenecks. It was tested only for a few times and is only for demonstration purposes.


##How the program works

###Installation 

Basically after compiling it. Run the program for the first time inside the folder because it will create the files listed : 

<ul>
 <li>AccLog.happ</li>
 <li>HouseDatabase.happ</li>
 <li>RealEstateDataFile.happ</li>
</ul>

Exit the program, and run it again to see the basic menu. 

###Usage

Instruction are in the application during runtime.
(Not too detailed sorry)


###Authentication
 AccLog where it reads the admin credentials first line username and second line password as shown 
 
 ```
 MohdVara
 thepassword
 MohdVara2
 thepassword
 ```
 
Credential are in plain text so it's not secure and the authentication is just for demonstration purposes. 
  
#####Disclaimer 
 
 
This program is just for demonstration purposes and should not be used in any production grade system without substantial re-factoring of the source code. I will not be responsible for any loss or damage caused by the program.
